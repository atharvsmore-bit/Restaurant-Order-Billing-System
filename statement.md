## 🔹 Problem Statement
Manual order taking and billing in restaurants can lead to errors, delays, and inefficiencies. Staff may overlook items, miscalculate totals, or take extra time to prepare the bill, resulting in customer dissatisfaction.  
There is a need for an automated billing solution that minimizes human error, saves time, and provides customers with a transparent and itemized receipt.
