# Restaurant-Order-Billing-System
A simple Restaurant Order Billing System built using pure Python.   It allows users to add menu items, place customer orders, apply discount %, calculate subtotal + GST, and generate a final bill — all through the command line.   The project is designed for academic learning using only basic Python concepts.
