## 🔹 Instructions for Testing

Follow the steps below to verify that the Restaurant Order Billing System works correctly:

| Test Step | Expected Output |
|----------|-----------------|
| Add menu item | Item should appear in the menu list with correct price |
| Show menu | All added items should display properly |
| Place order | Selected item and quantity should be added to the order list |
| Enter discount percentage | Bill total should reduce according to the discount applied |
| Generate bill | Subtotal, GST (5%), discount, and final payable total should be displayed |
| Order multiple items | Bill should include individual line totals for each item |

### Additional recommended tests
- Try **0% discount** — total should remain unchanged
- Try **10% / 20% / 50% discount** — total should reduce accordingly
- Try **ordering the same item multiple times**
- Try **large quantities** (e.g., 10 or more)
- Try generating the bill **only after placing an order** (system should warn if nothing is ordered)

If all of the above tests produce correct results, the project is functioning properly.
